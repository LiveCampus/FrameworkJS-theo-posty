# Known Limitations

- database.service needs a refactor, to get users statically without instance in the middleware to check authentication
- searching better way to handle adding and removing item from order (with quantity instead of multiple)
- add refresh token to avoid insecure token
- maybe sessions, cookies or api key to be more secure
- use something else than mongodb (this was cool to try in a little project like this)

# TODOS

- response error specify error field
- dto for product in order
- front
- storybook
- kubernetes
- api graphql
